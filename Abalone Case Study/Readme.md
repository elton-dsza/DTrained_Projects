<h1>Abalone Case Study</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

<h2>Attribute Information</h2>

Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict. 

<b>Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description</b><br>
Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)<br>
Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement<br>
Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length<br>
Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell<br>
Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone<br>
Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat<br>
Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)<br>
Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried<br>
Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years. <br>

You have to predict the rings of each abalone which will lead us to the age of that abalone.
